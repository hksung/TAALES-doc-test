## ngram range
- **Definition: Ngram range** represents the distribution or variety of n-grams across different sections or registers of a corpus, providing insights into their spread or generalizability. 
- It is particularly useful in determining how widely used specific sequences of words are in diverse contexts within a corpus.
- *TAALES* gives the mean bigram and trigram range scores, calculated by dividing the sum of range scores by the number of bigrams/trigrams in text with range scores, looking at five subcorpora of COCA (academic, fiction, magazine, news, spoken).
