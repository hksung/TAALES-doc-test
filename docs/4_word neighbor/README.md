# Word neighbor information

**Word neighborhood information** refers to the way words are connected based on shared orthographic (spelling), phonographic (spelling and sound), and phonological (sound) features (Peereman & Content, 1997). Words with many neighbors, i.e., those that can be formed by changing a letter or sound, are usually processed faster, while words with few neighbors tend to be formally complex and processed more slowly. Complex words with few neighbors, often seen in high-quality writing, can influence readability and perceived lexical sophistication.

In *TAALES 2.0*, key indices for measuring word neighborhood include counts of orthographic, phonological, and phonographic neighbors, as well as their frequency (how common these neighbors are) and Levenshtein distance (average letter or phoneme changes needed to reach the nearest neighbors).
