## Character bigram frequency

### Definition
Character bigram frequency refers to the average frequency of letter pairs (bigrams) within words, such as “DO” in DOG. This measure provides a proxy for the orthographic familiarity of a word and has been used in psycholinguistic research to reflect processing ease.

### Methodology
The index is computed by averaging the frequency counts of all character bigrams in each word. Scores are calculated across all words, content words, or function words. Raw words were used for the calculation.

### Corpus Used
Not tied to a specific corpus for calculation; referenced from Balota et al., (2007)

### Calculated indices
- BG_Mean
- BG_Mean_CW
- BG_Mean_FW
