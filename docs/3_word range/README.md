## Word range

- **Definition**: Refers to the number of texts in a corpus in which a particular item occurs.  
  - Less frequent words in a reference corpus (e.g., *edifice*, *cuisine*, *egregious*) are considered more sophisticated than frequently occurring words (e.g., *building*, *food*, *bad*).
  - While frequency has a strong relationship with language proficiency, it can be inflated by the high occurrence of technical words in a small subset of documents; Range norms help control frequency inflation and better approximate an individualâ€™s exposure to specific words. 
  - Words with restricted ranges are generally considered more sophisticated.
