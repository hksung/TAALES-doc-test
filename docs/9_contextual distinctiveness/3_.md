# Co-occurrence Probability (McD)

- **Description**: Probability that a word will co-occur with 500 highly frequent context lemmas; i.e., within 5 unigrams to the left and right of the target. Higher McD scores suggest the use of words that are more contextually distinct.
- **Methodology**: Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy) of lemmas
- **Type of unit**: Bit
- **Word types**:
    - ***McD_CD_AW***: All Words (AW)
    - ***McD_CD_CW***: Content Words (CW)
    - ***McD_CD_FW***: Function words (FW)
- **Corpus**: BNC (British National Corpus)
- **Register**: Spoken
