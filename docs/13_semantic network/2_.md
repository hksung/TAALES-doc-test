# Hypernymy Indices

- **Description**: These indices measure the hierarchical structure of words in the lexical network by quantifying hypernymy (i.e., the degree to which a word is a more general category of another word). The hypernymy indices provide insight into semantic abstraction and lexical specificity.
- **Methodology**: The scores are computed based on the path distance in the hypernymy hierarchy, considering different word senses and paths.
