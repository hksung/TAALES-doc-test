## Psycholinguistic norms
- **Definition**: Psycholinguistic norms, such as *concreteness*, *familiarity*, *meaningfulness*, and *imageability*, have long been studied by psycholinguists, cognitive scientists, and second language acquisition researchers (Coltheart, 1981; Crossley et al., 2016; Toglia & Battig, 1978). 
- These word properties are used to model various language-related phenomena, including:
    - *Writing quality scores* (Crossley & McNamara, 2011; Guo et al., 2013)
    - *Speaking proficiency* (Crossley & McNamara, 2013; Kyle & Crossley, 2015)
    - *Lexical proficiency* (Crossley et al., 2012; Kyle & Crossley, 2015)
    - *Lexical-decision times* (Kuperman et al., 2012)
    - *Word associations* (Altarriba et al., 1999)
- Studies have indicated that informal written texts in both L1 and L2 with a lower occurrence of concrete, familiar, imageable, and meaningful words tended to achieve higher lexical proficiency scores (Kyle & Crossley, 2015)
