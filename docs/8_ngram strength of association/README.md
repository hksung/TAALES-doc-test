## ngram strength of association

- **Definition: Ngram strength of association (SOA)** measures how strongly the words in an ngram are related to each other based on their co-occurrence patterns. 
- These indices are valuable for understanding collocations, idiomatic expressions, and overall cohesion within a text (Gablasova et al., 2017; O'Donnell et al., 2013).
- *TAALES* captures the dependency between words within bigrams and trigrams, using the following statistical measures, which are calculated based on the COCA subcorpora:
    - *(a) MI* (Mutual information) 
    - *(b) MI²* (Mutual information squared)
    - *(c) T* (T score)
    - *(d) DP* (Delta P)
    - *(e) AC* (Approximate Collexeme)
- Previous studies (e.g., Granger & Bestgen, 2014) show that intermediate L2 learners tend to underuse collocations with high MI and MI² scores, and to overuse collocations with high T-Scores.
