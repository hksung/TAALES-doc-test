# Contextual distinctiveness

- Definition: **Contextual distinctiveness** refers to how many different psychological, lexical or semantic contexts a word typically appears in, which can impact the perceived difficulty of a word. Research (Berger et al., 2017) shows that more proficient language learners tend to use words with higher contextual distinctiveness and difficulty.

- Tool: *TAALES 2.0* measures contextual distinctiveness for *(a)* all words, *(b)* content words (e.g., nouns, verbs), and *(c)* function words (e.g., prepositions, conjunctions) using several indices: 
	- *(1) McD* (McDonald & Shillcock, 2001), a corpus-based measure which calculates how predictable a word is based on its 5-word context; 
	- *(2) USF norms* (Nelson et al., 2004), which track how often a word is suggested by different cues in word association tests. 

- These indices capture how broadly or narrowly a word is used in various contexts by looking at:
	- *(1)* the variety of words that come to mind in response to a given word in free association; 
	- *(2)* the number of different prompts that trigger a specific word in free association tasks; 
	- *(3)* the probability of the word appearing near highly frequent words within a five-word window in text;
	- *(4)* the variability of contexts in which the word appears across 1,000-word sections of text.
