# Contextual distinctiveness

- **Contextual distinctiveness** refers to how many different psychological, lexical or semantic contexts a word typically appears in, which can impact the perceived difficulty of a word. For example... 
- Previous studies (e.g., Berger et al., 2017) found that more proficient language learners tend to use words with higher contextual distinctiveness and difficulty.

- Related indices capture how broadly or narrowly a word is used in various contexts by looking at:
	- *(1)* the variety of words that come to mind in response to a given word in free association; 
	- *(2)* the number of different prompts that trigger a specific word in free association tasks; 
	- *(3)* the probability of the word appearing near highly frequent words within a five-word window in text;
	- *(4)* the variability of contexts in which the word appears across 1,000-word sections of text.
