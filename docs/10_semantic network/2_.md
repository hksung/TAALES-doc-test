# Hypernymy 

- **Definition**: These indices measure the hierarchical structure of words in the lexical network by quantifying hypernymy (i.e., the degree to which a word is a more general category of another word).
- The scores are computed based on the path distance in the hypernymy hierarchy, which considers different word senses and paths.
