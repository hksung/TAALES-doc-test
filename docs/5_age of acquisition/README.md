## Age of Acquisition

- **Definition:** **Age of acquisition (AoA)** and/or **Age of exposure (AoE)** indicate the average age a native speaker learns or first encounters a word. 
- Previous studies showed that show that higher AoA/AoE scores correlate with less familiar, more advanced vocabulary, reflecting greater difficulty for language learners (e.g., Kuperman et al., 2012; Dascalu et al., 2016).
