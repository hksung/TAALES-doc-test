# Age of Exposure (AoE)
**Age of exposure (AoE)** refers to the age at which a person is first expected to encounter a particular word in an educational context. All AoE indices provide a measure of similarity based on words co-occurring in similar contexts.
- **Description**: Incremental score for words across 13 grade levels using LDA modeling
- **Methodology**: LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) modeling
- **Indices**:
    - ***aoe_inverse_average***: 1 - Avg(LDA cosine values)
    - ***aoe_inverse_linear_regression_slope***: 1/slope of linear regression based on LDA cosine values
    - ***aoe_index_above_threshold_40***: polynomial fit of degree 3 with an LDA cosine threshold of .40
    - ***aoe_inflection_point_polynomial***: polynomial fit of degree 3 with inflection point
- **Corpus**: TASA (Touchstone Applied Sciences Associates)
- **Register**: Educational texts
