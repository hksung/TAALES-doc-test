## ngram frequency
- **Definition**: Ngram frequency provides insights into the lexical sophistication of a text based on the number of occurences of *n* number of words. Research (O'Donnell et al., 2013; Bestgen & Granger, 2014) shows that, while high-frequency ngrams can offer information about the use of conventionalized language and formulaic sequences in texts, it does not necessarily have any implications for proficiency on its own. Instead, more information about ngram use, such as range and association, is needed.
