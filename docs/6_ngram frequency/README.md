## ngram frequency
- **Definition**: Ngram frequency is a measure used to analyze the lexical sophistication of a text by examining the frequency of occurrences of sequences of n words, such as bigrams or trigrams. High-frequency n-grams, such as the end of, out of the, and a lot of, are commonly found in texts, reflecting patterns of typical word combinations. In contrast, low-frequency n-grams, such as now not only, time some of, and is about being, occur less often, highlighting more unusual or less conventional word pairings.
- Individual words have traditionally been the primary unit of investigation in vocabulary and lexical development research (e.g., Laufer & Nation, 1995; Nation, 2006). Recent studies emphasize the significance of multiword units in language acquisition and development (Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; O’Donnell, Römer, & Ellis, 2013).
- Ngram frequencies have been used to model:
  - *Writing quality* (Bestgen & Granger, 2014; Crossley, Cai, & McNamara, 2012; Kyle & Crossley, 2016)  
  - *Speaking proficiency* (Kyle & Crossley, 2015)  
  - *Lexical proficiency scores* (Kyle & Crossley, 2015)
