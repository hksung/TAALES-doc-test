## Word recognition norms

- **Definition:** Word recognition norms measure the cognitive effort required to recognize and process words.
- These norms are based on average response times (latencies) and accuracy scores from lexical decision tasks (identifying if a word is real or not) and word-naming tasks (time taken to begin pronouncing a word) by native English speakers (Balota et al., 2007; Berger et al., 2017).
- Such norms provide insights into the ease or difficulty of processing specific words. They are valuable for modeling vocabulary development and assessing lexical proficiency, as words with longer response times generally indicate greater cognitive processing demands, potentially requiring higher language proficiency for quick access.
- In *TAALES*, these norms are calculated in various ways, such as mean response times, z-scores (standardized latencies), standard deviations, and accuracy rates, reflecting performance on lexical decision and word-naming tasks.
